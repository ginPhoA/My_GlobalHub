## Overview
<b>My_GlobalHub</b> is a <u>locally-hosted</u> Electron desktop application which acts as a central hub for launching and managing daily-used applications (e.g., Spotify, Chrome, Steam, etc.). The aim of the project is to rebuild and strengthen my individual coding skills by working on something fun and practical, while developing and using what I've learnt during my time at University.

### Tech Stack

### Prerequisites
#### Code Editor
I recommend opening the code in a text-editor like <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, however feel free to use what you personally prefer

You will need to install <b>Node.js</b> runtime, along with npm. You can head to `https://nodejs.org/en/download` to install both Node.js thats bundled with an npm package manager on your system.
